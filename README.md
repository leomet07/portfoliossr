# THIS SITE IS NOW DEPRECATED AND ARCHIVED

## My current portfolio is [github.com/leomet07/nextportfolio](https://github.com/leomet07/nextportfolio)

================================================

# My portfolio, made with nuxt

### This was made from my [vue portfolio](https://github.com/leomet07/vue-portfolio), but it is statically rendered, for faster load times.

After making a database or code change, the html must be rebuilt and redeployed to vercel, so run `deploy.bat`

To build a dist/ locally, run `npm run generate`

The site used to be live at [leomet07.vercel.app](https://leomet07.vercel.app).
This site has been taken down from production.

## .env Specifications

`DB_CONNECT={mongodb_srv_uri}`

## Analytics

This website uses [Umami](https://umami.is/) analytics. Why not Google Analytics? Because Google Analytics should be (and in some places are) illegal.
